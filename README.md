# Vacation Destination Project Phase I
This is project number 1 for the earnest novas group.  It is an activity planner based on inputs from the users.  The group has completed all the desired code to meet the goals for Phase I and there is plenty for the group to add in Phase II.  The reviews tab was included to complete the layout for future developments but was not expected to be and is not complete at this time.
